## falsePosition.m function
### Finds the roots of a function using the false position method
#### Inputs and Outputs
The function inputs are the function, the lower X value, the upper X value, the maximum relative error, and the maximun number of iterations

The function outputs are then the approximate root of the function, the value of the function at the root (f(x)), the approximate percent relative error, and the number of iterations it took to reach the approximated root 
#### Limitations
The function needs a minimum of three inputs

The function can only have five outputs maximum

Error if the x values have the same sign; they need to be different to bracket the root
