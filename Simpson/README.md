## Simpson.m function
### Simpson takes x and y value vectors for a function and integrates them using Simpson's 1/3 rule and maybe the Trapezoid rule if it so applies.
#### Inputs and Outputs
The function inputs are the X and Y value vectors

The function output is then the approximated integral of a function
#### Limitations
X and Y vectors must have the same dimensions

There must be equal spacing with the X vector
